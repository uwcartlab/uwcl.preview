BUFFER ZONE       "Zone Description" : "This zone is meant to buffer the Tambopata National Reserve from the negative environmental impacts of human activities in the surrounding area. Any activity is allowed in the Buffer Zone provided it does not harm the Tambopata Reserve. Mining, commercial agriculture, logging, or tourism must first conduct an environmental impact assessment, receive approval from the Peruvian Park Service, and obtain a legal concession before initiating approved activities. No government agency is officially designated with monitoring and managing the Buffer Zone."
COMMUNITY RESERVE "Zone Description" : "A zoning category invented and promoted by a group of local citizens involved in the participatory zoning process. It was not originally part of the formal zoning options presented to the roundtable by the Peruvian government. As proposed, this zone would allow all activities permitted in the Buffer Zone but only by local Tambopata residents."
STRICT PROTECTION "Zone Description" : "No human use, no roads, no buildings allowed."
WILDLANDS         "Zone Description" : "Similar restrictions to Strict Protection Zone with one exception: Ese�eja and Harakmbut indigenous peoples are allowed to hunt, fish, and collect non-timber forest products for subsistence."
ESEEJA AND HARAK  "Zone Description" : "Only Ese�eja and Harakmbut peoples have right to reside in this zone and use the land as they wish, including for agriculture. They can also hunt, fish, and harvest forest resources. Local Ese�eja and Harakmbut residents can mine, log, and/or run tourism businesses if they have appropriate concession permits."
TOURISM           "Zone Description" : "Tourism operators can operate in this zone with appropriate concession permit. Tourism lodges, cabins, and paths are allowed. Hunting and non-timber forest extraction are also allowed for subsistence or commercial purposes but only with appropriate permit. However, hunting endangered species is strictly forbidden (for everyone, including indigenous peoples)."
NON TIMBER        "Zone Description" : "Only Brazil nut harvest concessions, Brazil nut-related tourism, and subsistence hunting of non-endangered species is allowed.  "
DIRECT USE        "Zone Description" : "Hunting, fishing, and agriculture are allowed. Tourism, commercial agriculture, mining, and logging are permitted after first conducting an environmental impact assessment, receiving Park Service approval, and obtaining a legal concession."
RESTORATION       "Zone Description" : "Only activities that promote the ecological restoration of degraded habitats are permitted. In the future, sustainable use of regenerated forest is currently under consideration by the Park Service."
NATIONAL PARK     "Zone Description" : "A one million hectare park off limits to extraction. No new zoning within the park is being officially considered."
