				<h2>What's this assignment about?</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					Participatory zoning initiatives are underway in scores of protected areas in the tropics where forests are rich, but people are poor. Ideally, participatory zoning promises to
					<ul>
						<li>Balance conservation and development goals at the landscape scale</li>
						<li>Bring competing interest groups together to negotiate rules and create a shared sense of landscape</li>
						<li>Encourage greater stakeholder buy-in and avoid costly top-down enforcement</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					In this exercise, you will assume the role of a real-life stakeholder from Tambopata. Based on your stakeholder’s interests, you will define your land-use priorities for TNR, find allies, and negotiate with your opponents
					as you collectively negotiate and vote on one of four zoning proposal maps created in the local participatory planning process. In thinking about which map should guide land use activities in Tambopata’s future,
					consider the following: Why do your interests deserve priority? What kinds of activities will generate income without destroying biodiversity? Does your character have special interest in a certain area, e.g. the fertile,
					gold-rich and scenic riversides? Which areas have old-growth forests? Conversely, which areas are already deforested? Which activities are taking place up-stream from your character’s areas of interest?
				</p><p>
					You will advocate for your stakeholder’s vision for Tambopata by participating in a role-played roundtable and writing a position paper. At the roundtable and in the paper,
					you will identify the map you think best matches your character’s priorities, and (most importantly) defend your character’s position using <b>moral</b>, <b>environmental</b> and/or <b>economic</b> arguments:
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Moral Arguments:</u></b> Who should benefit from Tambopata’s forests and why? The area's original indigenous inhabitants? Or the largest group, namely small-scale farmers of mixed ancestry,
					some of whom have lived in Tambopata for decades, others only a few years? Which kinds of land use activities can offer security for Tambopata’s residents?
					Do Tambopata's forests and wildlife deserve protection apart from human economic concerns?
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Environmental Arguments:</u></b> What land uses are most likely to maintain biodiversity and/or other ecosystem services? How can environmentally destructive practices be mitigated?
					Why should certain activities be conducted in certain areas of TNR (e.g. where does old-growth forest persist? Where has forest already been cleared?
					Which areas are up/down stream? Which areas are closer to the Bahuaja-Sonene National Park?)?
				</p><p>
					<u><b>Economic Arguments:</u></b> Tambopata is poor. What kind of economic activities should have priority? Why? Which kinds of land use activities can generate capital and taxes to improve Tambopata’s services?
				</p>

				<h2>Tambopata, Peru: <br>Protecting forests and empowering local communities</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					The Tambopata National Reserve (TNR) was created in 1990 to protect one of the most biologically diverse and least disturbed forests on the planet. The region is also home to indigenous people, like the Ese’eja,
					who see their very survival threatened by development. Many other local residents see Tambopata as a poor region of Peru that contains untapped reserves of timber, gold, and farmland.
				</p><p>
					To balance biodiversity protection with economic development, officials are promoting participatory zoning of the 272,000 hectares of land within TNR.
					Leading this zoning exercise is Peru’s Ministry of the Environment. The Ministry has invited local stakeholder groups to propose zoning maps and promote their map at a public roundtable.
					The consensus map selected at the roundtable will guide future management.

				<h2>Key events in the history of Tambopata, Peru</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					<b>1890-1915:</b> The global demand for rubber leads companies to penetrate the forests of Tambopata to tap rubber trees. These companies bring the first wave of colonists, diseases, and market economies to the region.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>1930:</b> People begin to extract Brazil nuts from Tambopata for international markets. Small-scale gold mining begins.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>1990s:</b> The Tambopata Candamo Reserve Zone (TCRZ) is created as a temporary reserve on 1.5 million hectares, including uninhabited forests and areas settled by ~6000 people. The local farmers’
					federation FADEMAD and a local conservation group, Conservation Internacional-Peru (CI-Peru), work together to classify land in the region according to its agricultural potential and create a national park
					(“Bahuaja-Sonene”) (see VIDEO “Return to Tambopata”).
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Late 1990s, early 2000’s:</b> Participatory mapping and zoning exercises resume.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2000:</b> The Peruvian Congress passes a new Sustainable Forestry Law. A moratorium is temporarily placed on logging in the Peruvian Amazon due to “destructive, corrupt, and wasteful” practices.
					 Local loggers revolt and burn government vehicles and confiscated timber. They demand to log forests and to dissolve the TCRZ. The protestors set up a roadblock near the airport.
					 One person killed, offices burned. After three days, anti-riot police from Lima squelch the protest with tear gas and arrests. INRENA lifts the logging moratorium.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2008:</b>  As global economic crisis sets in, gold prices soar, and a gold rush brings tens of thousands of Peruvians to Tambopata.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2012:</b> SERNANP uses an emergency decree to halt mining within the Tambopata Reserve. Public riots break out. The National Federation of Miners of Peru strikes and burns government buildings.
					Six people die in the ensuing conflict. The decree stands. Peru’s military evicts most of the miners from the Reserve. Mining continues (illegally) in the proposed Buffer Zone.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>2020:</b> Mining conflicts continue to this day…

        <p>Participatory zoning processes like the one we re-enacted are underway in many protected areas in the tropics where biodiversity overlaps with poverty
             and management institutions are weak and underfunded. Ideally, participatory zoning balances ecosystem conservation and economic development goals
             across large areas and among diverse stakeholders. Community mapping can bolster traditional resource use claims. Zoning can also highlight areas
             of special importance for protecting water and wildlife.</p>

        <p>So, in sum, why go through all the effort to engage stakeholders and do participatory zoning?<p>
            <ul>
                <li>To balance conservation and development goals at the landscape scale.</li>

        <h2>What happened in Tambopata in real life?</h2>
            <p>Participatory zoning has been underway in one form or another in Tambopata for nearly two decades. Some past participatory zoning efforts have
                focused on agricultural development or mining outside protected areas.</p><p>Our re-enactment matches an effort launched in 2001 that was funded
                by the Macarthur Foundation and led by Peruvian conservationists. In reality, more than a dozen zoning maps were proposed by various
                stakeholder groups over the course of years. We selected and simplified four of these proposed maps to use in this exercise.</p>

        <p>Given that this exercise was funded and led by conservationists, ‘forest friendly’ groups were privileged from the start, namely Brazil nut harvesters,
            ecotourism operators, ecologists, the Federation of Indigenous peoples (FENAMAD), and the Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD). However, FADEMAD
            was relatively large and powerful, and its members included some miners and loggers. Thus, after several roundtables and
            debates, participants chose Proposal #2, a simplified version of the map originally proposed by FADEMAD.</p><p>Proposal #2 was thought to best balance
            competing interests. Notably, in place of the Buffer Zone, the participants recommended a new zoning category (a ‘Community Reserve’) that allowed
            all kinds of activities, but only if they were conducted by Tambopata residents. Miners were allocated the gold-rich riverbanks along the Malinowski
            in the NW section of the Reserve.</p>

        <p>This consensus map was sent for approval to Peru’s Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) in Lima, where it sat for a year under consideration.
            When INRENA finally sent the formally approved zoning map back to Tambopata, stakeholders were met with a surprise: INRENA designated a Buffer Zone,
            arguing that ‘Community Reserve’ was not a legally recognized land use zone.</p><p>INRENA also erased the direct use zone along the Malinowski River meant
            for mining, hoping this would protect the source of water for the growing city of Puerto Maldonado from mercury contamination. Additionally, in 2010
            the Peruvian Government established a formal mining corridor where mining could legally take place with formal permits; however, mining continues
            to occur outside of this legally designated area.</p>

        <p>Local reaction to the final, INRENA-approved map was mixed. Some <b>Ese’eja</b> citizens were pleased to see ecotourism granted big areas; other Ese’eja opposed
            this. <b>Brazil nut harvesters</b> were encouraged by the formal public support of their activity. The zoning exercise made them feel more confident in
            their rights to exclude loggers and farmers from the old-growth forest where they harvest Brazil nuts, but they admit hunting is not controlled.</p><p>
            Most participants believed <b>mining</b> on the Malinowski would not stop even if it was forbidden on the zoning map. Similarly, many felt the Buffer Zone
            was only a designation on paper, not one that would be enforced in reality.</p>

        <h2>Questions to reflect on:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Do you think your character would approve of the final zoning map?</li>
                <li>Would s/h/ze describe the process as truly ‘participatory’?</li>
                <li>Stepping out of character, do you think Peruvian conservationists leading this exercise made the right choice to limit the voice of mining, industrial agriculture,
                    and logging in the zoning process for the Reserve?</li>
                <li>Based on your experience in this activity, in a sentence or two, describe a few opportunities and challenges to taking a participatory approach to zoning.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>The mixed results of Participatory Zoning at Tambopata</h2>
        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise succeed at balancing conservation & development at the landscape scale?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Failures: </i></b>Despite the zoning effort, some illegal logging continued in the NE corner of the Tambopata National Reserve (TNR) and
                neighboring indigenous territories. Worse, as expected, illegal gold mining activities exploded in the Buffer Zone and along the upper Malinowski
                River. In 2018 alone, mining destroyed over 9,000 hectares of forests (that’s about 18,000 football fields).</p>

            <p>Here you can see the rapid explansion in two areas of the Buffer Zone:</p>

            <p>Some groups hope that former alluvial mining sites can be reforested after mining. But restoring these highly contaminated, sandy soils is difficult,
                and the planted trees that survive grow slowly. <a href="https://cincia.wfu.edu/en/" target="_blank">CINCIA</a>, a non-profit working to restore Peru’s Amazonian landscape, is piloting remediation
                techniques involving biocarbon to improve tree growth and survivorship in the post-mining site pictured below. Tree growth is slow given
                the severely degraded soils.</p>

            <p><b><i>Successes: </i></b>Forests in the TNR are still fairly well protected. There is negligible mining in the Reserve (despite the presence of
                gold deposits). Instead, more forest-friendly activities predominate, such as Brazil nut harvesting and tourism. </p>

            <p>A few Brazil nut harvesters have also embarked on small commercial ventures that offer tourists a chance to harvest Brazil nuts and stay in rustic
                cabins. Excelsa, pictured below, is one such site. Here a Brazil nut harvester allowed forest to grow back on his pastures, hoping this will
                attract tourists. </p>

            <p>A broader conservation achievement is the fact that the adjacent one million-hectare Bahuaja-Sonene National Park is still mostly protected
                (partly because it is so remote). However, unlike Tambopata, most participatory zoning in the tropics happens where there is no huge,
                intact national park next door. The social and ecological stakes of participatory zoning are higher when there is no other forested area
                left for conservation or sustainable use.</p>

        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise succeed at bringing competing groups together to negotiate rules and creating a shared sense of landscape?
            Did it avoid conflicts & costly, top-down enforcement?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Failures: </i></b>Conservation continues to be a politically charged issue at Tambopata. On one hand, the mayor of the region’s capital,
                Puerto Maldonado, declared the city the ‘Biodiversity Capital of Peru”. But some defiant leaders of loggers and miners have been elected to
                public office by running their campaigns on anti-conservation messages. The explosion of illegal gold mining ultimately required expensive,
                militarized enforcement (see next).</p>

            <p><b><i>Successes: </i></b>Although participatory zoning didn’t ‘win over’ all residents to a conservation mindset, it raised public awareness.
                Prior to the exercise, most residents knew little about the TNR, whereas after, many understood TNR’s conservation significance. In particular,
                locals had a better awareness of Brazil nut and tourism concessions, the location of the Buffer Zone, etc.</p><p>Most notably, this activity helped
                to strengthen a new Local Management Committee made up of zoning exercise participants and led by the former Agrarian Federation (FADEMAD) leader.
                Together they have achieved remarkable impact, e.g. working with the press and civic organizations to alert the public to mercury pollution,
                creating an anonymous ‘hotline’ to report mining infractions, and blowing the whistle on corruption in the mining sector.</p><p>Confronting
                mining is very risky given the enormous profits and criminality of many operations. Management Committee leaders regularly receive death threats.
                This committee is also working with government agencies to improve the mining formalization process. So effective is this committee that the
                Peruvian government had them coach management committees around other protected areas. The government is even considering expanding the Buffer
                Zone at Tambopata, assuming the Local Management Committee can extend its good work (a tall ask given that they are already stretched thin).

            <p>In February 2019, Peru’s government launched ‘Operation Mercury,’ a multisector governmental operation to confront the illegal mining crisis
                in this region. This crackdown significantly slowed gold mining deforestation in the Buffer Zone and kept it from penetrating the TNR and the
                Bahuaja-Sonene National Park.</p>

        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise improve local leadership & technical planning skills?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Success! </i></b>Stakeholders’ involvement in the exercise allowed them to build new institutions to support decision making.
                Many participants became members of the Local Management Committee that oversees the Buffer Zone.</p>

        <h3><i>Did the participatory zoning exercise protect areas of special ecological importance?</i></h3>

            <p><b><i>Mixed Results: </i></b>The Malinowski River, an important headwater, was severely damaged by mining despite zoning protection. Most
                forest is protected in the TNR and the Bahuaja-Sonene Park.</p>

        <h2>Challenges & Uncertainties of Participatory Zoning efforts</h2>
            <p><b><i>HIGHLY POLITICAL?</i></b><br>Yes, very! Zoning is not just about <b><u>where</u></b> resources will be used, but <b><u>who</u></b> gets access.</p>

            <p><b><i>SLOW?</i></b><br>Yes, this was a >5-year process. The government then spent more than a year after the roundtable formalizing and adjusting
                the map chosen at the roundtable. Zoning is still adjusted every couple of years, but each time, it builds on previous zoning efforts and
                concerns a smaller area.</p>

            <p><b><i>DEMOCRATIC?</i></b><br>Some stakeholders (e.g. Brazil nut harvesters) gained influence via the zoning process. But miners, industrial
                agriculturalists, and loggers were not even invited to the roundtable because conservationists thought their activities were not compatible
                with TNR goals.</p>

            <p><b><i>INEFFECTIVE?</i></b><br>Pluralistic processes like participatory land use zoning tend to favor ambiguous rules for zones (e.g. the
                Community Reserve zone). This ambiguity helps bring competing stakeholders together, but it makes subsequent enforcement difficult. Also,
                in this case (like many others), international donors funded the zoning exercise (~US$ 500k total) but did not provide funds for subsequent
                enforcement.</p>

        <h4><b>TAKEAWAY:</b></h4>
            <p><i>Participatory zoning</i> is an example of <b>community-engaged</b> conservation. It is <b>slow, politically fraught work, but it is key to
                enduring land stewardship</b>. Also remember, <b>local zoning efforts are inadequate to defend land from activities like mining</b>.
                Controlling a high-profit, highly destructive activity like mining requires <b>both community engagement and strong government support</b>.</p>
