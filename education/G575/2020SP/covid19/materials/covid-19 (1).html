        <br>
        <p>
          Timelines of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China and the U.S. reveal detailed stories of how the first few cases gradually developed into a pandemic, and how government officials and health agencies acted together in fighting the transmission of the virus outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
          China and the United States exhibited different spatial patterns of coronavirus spread in their respective regions. <b>In China, most cases originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province.</b> Direct controls of the origin of the virus (such as the shutdown of the city and later the province) helped prevent the virus from spreading further. <b>In the U.S., however, the first few confirmed cases were scattered across states on the east and west coasts</b>, which made containment problematic and required nation-wide preventive measures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Both governments have struggled to assess the virus accurately in terms of its severity</b>. Coronavirus was underestimated and was not acted upon proactively. Chinese officials took three weeks to confirm human-to-human transmission. The U.S. government, even having received warnings about COVID-19 from WHO and having weeks to prepare, didn’t introduce social distancing and stay-at-home policies until it was too late to prevent mass contamination. A lack of testing kits and necessary medical care equipment has also plagued the effectiveness of the response.
        </p>
        <p>
          China and America have not succeeded in stopping the spread of COVID-19, but most of the world has failed as well. The global community was not prepared for the coronavirus, but it will also learn from its mistakes. <b>COVID-19 is truly the first pandemic of the modern era and will serve as a landmark case in which health organizations and officials will look back on to aid them in future times of pandemic crises</b>. It is a painful but necessary lesson the world needed to learn in order to strive forward confidently in the future. <b>It will certainly not be the last time there will be a global health emergency, but with the selflessness shown by healthcare workers and other essential employees today, there is certainly cause for hope looking ahead</b>.
