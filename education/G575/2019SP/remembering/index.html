These people were virtually destroyed by the subsequent immigration that created the United States. <b id='bold'>This tragedy is the direct result of treaties, written and broken by foreign governments, of warfare, and of forced assimilation</b>.

This was the final battle of the Creek War of 1813-14. In treaty signed after the battle, <b id='bold'>the Creeks ceded more than 21 million acres of land</b>  to the United States.”

Adams defended Jackson, citing the necessity to restrain the Indians and escaped slaves since the Spanish failed to do so. Adams used Jackson’s military action to present Spain with a demand to either control the inhabitants of East Florida or cede it to the United States. Spain ceded East Florida to the United States and renounced all claim to West Florida.”

                            Since 1848, Native Americans and Mexican Americans have struggled to achieve political and social equality within the United States, often citing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as a document that promised civil and property rights. Although the treaty promised U.S. citizenship to former Mexican citizens, the Native Americans in the ceded territories, who in fact were Mexican citizens, were not given full U.S. citizenship until the 1930s.”
